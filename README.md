# TheJourney
To the yogurt, does someone ever reads the first commit? Lets throw some hints, that will help you to find the flag.
Copilot writes too >:D

## Manifesto
Lets write a manifesto, for the journey of a creation for a digital cooperative.

Main idea is to have something that all integrants can use, and that can be used by the community.
Free and open source, and with a good documentation.

### Roules
- No one is allowed to be a boss
- No one is allowed to be a slave


## Suggar (Monetary part)
What if we create a something that being sell at X value (How many sells?), gives us a year Y of money

## Steps(?)
- [ ] Create a repository

### Values
- We are all equal
- We are all different
- We are all unique
- We are all the same
- We are all one
- And we are on the same ship

## Lectures
Notes, thoughts, ideas, and more. Also, someone once told that i should read it (You could improve if you read one of these...).
