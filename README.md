To the yogurt, does someone ever reads the first commit? Lets throw some hints, that will help you to find the flag.
Copilot writes too >:D

## Manifesto
Lets write a manifesto, for the journey of a creation for a digital cooperative.

Main idea is to have something that all integrants can use, and that can be used by the community.
Free and open source, and with a good documentation.

### Roules
- No one is allowed to be a boss
- No one is allowed to be a slave


## Suggar (Monetary part)
What if we create a something that being sold at X value (How many sells?), gives us a year Y of money
-3 CVs could cost up to (5000 each) T:15000, means anually: 15000*12 = 180000 (180k)
-Reinvest money on departments (1 department means 1 partner of the cooperative)
So 20 partners, means 180k*20 = 3600000 (3.6M, to have a stable rent for each partner) (Rent as option to reinvest on the cooperative)
-3600000 at a 5000 cv means 720 CVs (720 CVs to be sold at 5000 each) If further 720CVs a year per month 60CVs, means 60*12 = 720CVs a year (Can this be achieved?)

-Alternative projects (What if we get some investors, we can take our part here for the cooperative *For everyone, and eat cake) (If we have the talent, like 3 CVs)
3Cvs at value of 200K proj We could split the cake in 4, 3 devs plus 1 point for cooperative (50k per project sold)
This means how many projects do we need to sell: 3600000/50000 = 72 projects a year (6 projects a month) (Can this be achieved? More? less?)

If we have a good flow of CVs incomming/being filtered by our portal,  we can achieve multiples tactics at once (We can have a good flow of CVs, meaning a good flow of projects, and good CV sold)
## Steps(?)
